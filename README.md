# Museum Artwork Website

This is a Museum Artwork Website that I made using NextJS, React, Bootstrap, MongoDB and Jotai.

The user is able to sign up and log into the website, search the database for different pieces of museum artwork, view details about a specific artwork and save that artwork to a favorites list that they can access at any time. The website also tracks past searches.
